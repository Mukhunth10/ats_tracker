/**
 * Client-side attention monitor.
 *
 * Runs Google's MediaPipe face-landmark model on the candidate's webcam, in
 * their browser, for free. It estimates whether they are facing the screen and
 * counts sustained periods of looking away.
 *
 * Design decisions that matter, all aimed at NOT wrongly flagging good people:
 *   - It's a REVIEWER AID, never a verdict. The output is "worth a look",
 *     handed to a human who watches the actual footage.
 *   - Only *sustained* looking-away counts. A glance at the keyboard or a
 *     moment's thought (under AWAY_GRACE_MS) is ignored — that's normal, and
 *     especially normal for CAD work on dual monitors.
 *   - Everything is best-effort and fail-open: if the model can't load, or a
 *     frame errors, monitoring silently does nothing and the assessment
 *     proceeds. A detection library must never be able to block someone's test.
 *
 * Head turn is estimated from face geometry (nose position relative to the eye
 * centre, normalised by eye distance) rather than raw matrix decomposition —
 * simpler and more robust across faces, glasses, and lighting.
