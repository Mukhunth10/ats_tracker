 *
 * This only checks that a session cookie EXISTS; it does not validate it,
 * because the proxy runs before the database is reachable in some deployments.
 * Real validation happens in every page, Server Action and API route via
 * requireUser(). Treat this as a redirect for humans, not as the security
